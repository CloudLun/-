# Data Station Competition

The Ximen shopping district has been profoundly affected by the repercussions of COVID-19. In an effort to bolster the district's resilience during these challenging times, the team formulated a comprehensive solution. This involved a meticulous assessment of the current situation, followed by the creation of a mapping visualization and a well-defined commercial strategy. Leveraging a combination of open resources, geographical points of interest (POI), and data sourced from mobile devices, we successfully developed an interactive mapping website. This website serves as a powerful analytical tool, facilitating effective communication with both the general public and commercial entities. The aspiration behind this tool is to empower the district and its community to cultivate a more precise marketing plan, thereby enabling them to be better prepared for the dynamic landscape of the post-pandemic era.
